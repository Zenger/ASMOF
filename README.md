ASMOF
====

Another Slightly Modified Options Framework

This is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/syamilmj/Options-Framework">SMOF</a> but with many many other tricks in it.
First instead of just using a global array it usses a class to store all your options in a static variable and then it populates the field of the ASMOF.

It uses a restructured logic of getting the defaults, it will use your defaults which you have configured at the start and you won't need to make 2 different versions of your settings.

A completely redesigned layour with proper icon setup, you don't have to interefere in Options Framework CSS to add your own icons.

Retina input - a slightly modified upload input which allows uploading a simple and a 2x sized image for retina devices, you'll have to work that on the client side on your own ;)
